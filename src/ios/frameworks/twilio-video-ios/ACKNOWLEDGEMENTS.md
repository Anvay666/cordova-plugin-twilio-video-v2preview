This software includes BoringSSL under the following license:

	BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
	licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
	license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

	Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
	https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

	Some files from Intel are under yet another license, which is also included
	underneath.

	The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
	OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
	for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
	licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
	openssl-core@openssl.org.

	The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
	some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
	record keeping.)
